# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> This repository contains my code and report on MNIST data, classifying them based on which digit each data point belongs to, from 0 to 9.

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

I have uploaded algorithms.py, which contains all the algorithms I have tried for the assignment. I have also uploaded main.py, which has the final algorithm I have used. There is a report da24b002.pdf detailing my thought processes and observations.

---

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* pip install numpy
* pip install pandas

---

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

Change the file paths in both algorithms.py and main.py for the train and validation files. Uncomment the algorithm that is being tested in algorithms.py before running.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
